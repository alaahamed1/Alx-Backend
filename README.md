**Technical Details**

This project leverages Vue.js for its frontend due to its reactive capabilities and smooth user experience. Laravel was chosen for the backend because of its simplicity in handling API integration and managing data flow.

One of the key challenges was implementing real-time solar energy data simulation. The data flow optimization was achieved by caching API responses in the Laravel backend, reducing delays and enhancing responsiveness.

**Inspiration and Vision**

Growing up in an arid region, Iâ€™ve seen firsthand how environmental challenges affect communities. This project is a step toward addressing those challenges through technology. Moving forward, I hope to improve the simulation accuracy and integrate more energy-efficient solutions.
