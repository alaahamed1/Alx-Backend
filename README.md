## **Technical Details**

This project leverages Vue.js for the frontend due to its reactivity and smooth user experience. For the backend, Laravel was chosen for its robust handling of API integrations and seamless data flow management.

### **Key Challenges**

One of the key challenges was implementing real-time solar energy data simulation. This was achieved by caching API responses in the Laravel backend, improving performance and minimizing delays.

### **Inspiration and Vision**

Growing up in an arid region, I witnessed the environmental challenges faced by local communities. This project represents a step toward addressing those challenges using renewable technology. Future iterations aim to increase simulation accuracy and explore more energy-efficient solutions.
